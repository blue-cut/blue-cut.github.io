# Getting started

First, you need the ruby development headers. Run :  
* On Fedora : `dnf install ruby-devel`
* On Debian-based distributions : `apt-get install ruby-dev`

to install dependencies, run :  
```sh
bundle install
```

You can now serve the website locally with :  
```sh
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
